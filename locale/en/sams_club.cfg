nf-filter-inserter=you shouldn't be able to see this, but it re-uses stored items in intermediate products.
nf-fast-inserter=you shouldn't be able to see this, but it pushes the output chest inventory to the belt
nf-output-combinator=Outputs a signal for each item that is needed to craft the current recipe.
nf-input-combinator=Attach a signal wire here that represents what is already available, e.g. a chest or a roboport for logistic access. This tells the crafter to properly calculate how much item is needed.
nf-recipe-combinator=Select what you want to craft, and how many. If this becomes cleared out at any time then the inventory will be dumped.
nf-chest=you shouldn't be able to see this, but it's a temporary internal storage chest
nf-belt=Output belt
